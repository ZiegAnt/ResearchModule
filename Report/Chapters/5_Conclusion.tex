\section{Conclusion}\label{section:Conclusion}

DD most detailed but SNR might be problemtaic in field, wa and slm more robust (consider several configs)
finer meshing might lead to better image but higher costs
ert and tt in good accordance useful for combined inversion
methods most sensitive to upper part of diatreme retrieved accurate
tt struggle imaging diatreme homogeneously cause low velocity intrusion
anomaly senseable with gravimetry
gravity data could complement existing datasets (might help to overcome limited depth of tt and ert)
might improve models
