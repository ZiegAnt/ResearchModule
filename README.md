A synthetic data study for a volcanic diatreme structure is planned.
First a model is generated with GemPy which then will be used for forward calculations in pygimli.

sp_creation_cone.py: Python script to produce csv-file containing surface points of geologic structures

RM_gempy_model_layers.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for creation of gempy model of layered subsurface

RM_gempy_model_diatreme.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for creation of gempy model of daitreme structure
